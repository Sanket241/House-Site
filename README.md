# House-Site

I created a house website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML provided the structure of the site, defining elements like headers, paragraphs, and images. CSS was used to style the website, making it visually appealing by setting colors, fonts, and layouts. JavaScript added interactivity, enabling features such as image sliders, interactive forms, and navigation menus.

The HTML structure organized content into sections like home, about, gallery, and contact, ensuring a clear and logical flow. CSS helped in designing the site, with responsive layouts for different screen sizes, creating a cohesive and user-friendly experience. JavaScript enhanced functionality, allowing users to interact with the image gallery.
